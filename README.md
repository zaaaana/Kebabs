# Kebabs - A GIS Report
### A network analysis report, which aims to solve a 'travelling salesman' problem via ArcMap

The project is centralised around University College London (UCL) as the starting point, and the highest-rated kebab shops across London. In this report, network analysis is used to determine the most viable route when visiting specific kebab shops as stated by the user, via walking, London Underground, or driving. 

For this report, the London Underground Lines were segmented according to stations, and exit / transfer points added in order for the application to include the time spent transferring lines and walking from the station to a specified shop.

Some limitations were present, such as the inability to fully incorporate the Northern Line, due to ArcMap deeming that the connection between Euston and Mornington Crescent Stations were a loop as opposed to separate stops. In addition to this, driving routes did not fully account for traffic levels, congestion zones or dual carriageways, and so these results may not have been the most accurate based on current road regulations.
